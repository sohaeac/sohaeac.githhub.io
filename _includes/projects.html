    <h3> Mandelbrot Viewer </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Verify if a complex number belongs to the Mandelbrot Set</li>
      <li>Compute the Mandelbrot set pixel by pixel</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop.Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Abstract fractals – such as the Mandelbrot Set – can be generated by a computer calculating a simple equation over and over.</p>

      <li>Prediction of Heart Disease</li>
      <li>Libraries: Numpy, Sklearn, Pandas</li>
    </ul>
    <p>WHO announced that cardiovascular diseases is the top one killer over the world. There are seventeen million people died from it every year, especially heart disease. Prevention is better than cure.</p>
    <p>This is a machine learning model that can predict whether a person has heart disease or not </p>
